            <title><![CDATA[Release Notes]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[This is possibly the biggest Revapi release in its 7 years history. Prominently, this release finally
introduces an almost all-powerful filtering of java elements using the
https://github.com/revapi/classif[Classif] library and thus closes one of the oldest open issues -
https://github.com/revapi/issues/17[#17] (almost exactly 5 years old).]]></description>
