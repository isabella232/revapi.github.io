        Revapi has started to use Java 9 for building while maintaining compatibility with Java 8 using the Animal Sniffer Maven
        plugin. This has proven to be problematic and the last releases could not be used with
        Java 8. This should be now fixed and compatibility with Java 8 restored.

        It was discovered that the analysis may fail if it encounters classes that are missing from the dependency graph
        in certain situations. This should now be fixed and all users are encouraged to upgrade to using
        revapi-java-0.14.4 if possible.
